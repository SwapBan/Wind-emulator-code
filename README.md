# Wind-emulator-code

The proposed wind emulation platform is wind-turbine-oriented, with significantly increased traceability and efficiency when compared to existing systems. The wind emulation system is driven with real-time wind velocity data. The real-time and forecasted wind data is fetched from global nodes using an IoT cloud application programming interface. The wind emulation system is modeled in the VEE Pro platform and integrated with IoT cloud API and FPGA controller. Data obtained from IoT is converted into actionable information to analyze and investigate wind turbine performance. Also, effective security measures have been taken for ESP8266 communication with the Host Computer. Adapting the proposed IoT algorithm with an associated hardware prototype, the condition of the wind energy conversion system and the power generation capability shall be analyzed in a real-time environment.
